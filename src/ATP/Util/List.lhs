* Util

Generate small ints

> ints :: Int -> Gen Int
> ints n = Q.choose (0, n)

Lists with a maximum length.

> list :: Int -> Gen [Int]
> list 0 = return []
> list n 
>  | n > 0 = Q.oneof [ return [], M.liftM2 (:) Q.arbitrary (list $ n-1) ]
>  | otherwise = error "Impossible" 

Lists with very few possibilities for values.

> list' :: Int -> Int -> Gen [Int]
> list' 0 _ = return []
> list' n m
>  | n > 0 = Q.oneof [ return [], M.liftM2 (:) (ints m) (list' (n-1) m) ]
>  | otherwise = error "Impossible"

** all2

all2 f xs ys 

returns true iff the lengths of xs and ys are the same and 
f xi yi --> True for all i < length xs

> all2 :: (a -> b -> Bool) -> [a] -> [b] -> Bool
> all2 _ [] [] = True

> all2 _ _ _ = False

** allPairs

allPairs f xs ys

returns f applied to all pairs of an element of xs with an element of ys

> allPairs :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
> allPairs f xs ys = [f x y | x <- xs, y <- ys]

** allInjectiveMaps

| Given two lists l1 l2 where |l1| >= |l2|, return all
injective maps between the two lists.  For example
allInjectiveMaps [1,2,3] [4,5,6] = [[(1,4), (2,5), (3,6)], [(1,5),(2,4),(3,6)], ...]

> allInjectiveMaps :: [a] -> [b] -> [[(a,b)]]
> allInjectiveMaps [] _ = [[]]

>   let sels = map (flip select ys) [0..length ys-1] 
>       f (y, ys') = map ((x, y):) (allInjectiveMaps xs ys')
>   in concat $ map f sels

> prop_allInjectiveMaps_length :: Property
> prop_allInjectiveMaps_length = Q.label "allInjectiveMaps_length" $

| Insert an element at a given position in a list.  
insertAt n x l is a list where x is the nth element.

** select

| Grab the nth element out of a list and return the element with
the modified list.

> select n (x:xs) = (y, x:xs')

** splits 

| Return all sublists of a list with the corresponding list difference

> splits :: [a] -> [([a], [a])]
> splits [] = [([], [])]
